Q3 a)
My Model results  for the real estate price prediction regression problem:
RMSE and MAE Scores on trainset:

RMSE: 5.4834018579609145

MAE: 3.90624246607995

RMSE and MAE Scores on Testset:

RMSE: 10.830034652628964

MAE: 6.452982776813269
Q3 b)
Sklearn Model resuls  for the real estate price prediction regression problem:
RMSE and MAE Scores on trainset:

RMSE: 5.483401857960915

MAE: 3.90624246607995

RMSE and MAE Scores on testset:
RMSE: 10.747045699784751

MAE: 6.389328158339375
Hence, we can see that there is no much difference in the results obtained from my model and sklearn model.
